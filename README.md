# Random Access Mind
A simple add-on for [Trickster](https://github.com/enjarai/trickster) that implements an alternative to the Crow Mind. The Random Access Mind provides the caster with twelve slots where they may store any fragment, managed using an allocation system. This allows for multiple concurrent spells to store semi-persistent arbitrary data without conflict. Of course, just like the Crow Mind, data does not persist beyond death. 

In addition to Trickster, this mod depends on [libstellar](https://github.com/StellarWitch7/libstellar), my personal Kotlin library for making Fabric mods. 

# Other additions
Versions 2.0.0 and up include more than just RAM, providing a handful of tricks for dealing with pattern fragments.
